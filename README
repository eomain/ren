Ren

A data-driven, event based library for communicating with the underlying
windowing system (X11, XCB, etc.) via a relatively stateless and extensible
messaging interface.
Messages exchanged between the client program and the display server, can
be either a request (e.g. map the window) or a response (e.g. a key-press).
